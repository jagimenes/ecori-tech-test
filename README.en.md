## Tech test to integrate the Ecori Team ☀

<br>

## Create a Rest API and a task management SPA. <br>

## :computer: Functionalities (Back-end)
🔴 A route of **tasks listing**, receiving parameters like filters (_title_ ou _description_) and pagination (_page_ e _pageSize_);<br>
🔴 A route of **task creation**, receiving fields, _title_, _description_. The complete object, on database, should have more 3 fields: _completed_at_ (to control when the task is done), _created_at_ (to control when the task was created) and _updated_at_ (to control when the task was updated);<br>
🔴 A route of **task update**, receiving by route params the task _id_, and receiving fields like _title_, _description_;<br>
🔴 A route of **task removal**, receiving by route params the task _id_;<br>
🔴 A route of **mark task as done**, receiving by route params the task _id_;<br>
**Other suggestions**<br>
🟢 **Bonus 1**: Importing tasks, with a list of _title_ and _description_, from a CSV file;<br>
🟢 **Bonus 2**: Auth control with login;<br>
